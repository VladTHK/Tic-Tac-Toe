## About the Project
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic game implemented in Rust that runs entirely in the terminal. This version uses only the basic standard library of Rust, making it lightweight and easy to understand or modify.

## Features
- The game is played on a traditional 3x3 grid in the terminal interface.
- Includes a built-in bot opponent.
- The bot is trained to either win or force a draw, making it nearly impossible to beat.
- Ideal for those looking to learn Rust basics through a simple interactive CLI game with AI.

## Running the Game
Make sure Rust is installed. From the project directory, run: 
`cargo run`

The game will launch in the terminal and prompt you to make moves, displaying the board after each turn.

## Purpose
The main goal of this project is to demonstrate Rust’s capabilities for building interactive command-line applications and basic AI using only the standard library.
